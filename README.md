# REQUITE_RAanalysis
impact of rhuematoid arthiritis on toxicity in REQUITE cohorts


Scripts for calculating 
1. acute STAT for prostate patients
2. late toxicity STAT with patient reported outcomes for prostate patients
3. late toxicity STAT with clinician reported outcomes for prostate patients

also availab le Brian Langs R code for calculating the PRS and weighted PRS scores for all REQUITE patients using the data published in this paper:
https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12873#Sec15



keep common variables for cross dataset
REQUITE to select further for exploratory models

Look at A Bartons new list - paper published?

to do - 
calculate PRS and wPRS with updated list of snps
use current and new snps in analysis
  STAT
    prostate acute
    prostate late - patient reported and clinician reported
  residuals
  individual toxicity end-points


Breast and Lung - need full genomic data

look at incoperating the rectum / bladder doses

variable selection for REQUTE data
